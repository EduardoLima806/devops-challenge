2. Prerequisites - What needs to be set up before deployment (AWS credentials,
Terraform state, etc.)
3. Deployment Instructions - Step-by-step guide to deploy the infrastructure and

4. CI/CD Flow - Explanation of how the pipeline works
5. Security Considerations - What security measures you implemented and what
you'd add in production

Additionally, covers:
